title: Zero-shot object counting with visual feature extraction and language-guidance
abstract: Zero - Shot Object Counting (ZSC) focuses on counting objects of any class
  in a query image without the need for user - supplied exemplars. Recently, ZSC has
  attracted growing interest because of its broad applicability and higher efficiency
  when contrasted with Few - Shot Object Counting (FSC). Different from FSC, a significant
  problem in existing ZSC methods is their failure to efficiently recognize high -
  quality exemplar features. In this paper, we propose a Zero-Shot Object Counting
  network with Visual Feature Extraction and Language-Guidance (VELG). Through the
  visual feature extraction module, we progressively fuse the scale and geometric
  information of the exemplars. Meanwhile, we introduce a language-guidance module
  that helps the exemplar learn informative image-level visual representations and
  refine the exemplar features using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training. Extensive
  experiments on the FSC147 and CARPK datasets verify the accuracy and strong generalizability
  of the proposed approach.
