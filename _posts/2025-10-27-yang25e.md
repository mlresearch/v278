title: Competitive Influence Maximization Across Social Networks
abstract: " The proliferation of Web 2.0 technologies has significantly reshaped information
  propagation dynamics across social media platforms. While existing studies extensively
  analyze influence maximization within single-platform environments, competitive
  propagation dynamics across multiple interconnected social networks remain underexplored.
  Addressing this research gap, we define the Competitive Influence Maximization Across
  Social Networks (CIMASN) problem and introduce a novel Competitive Independent Cascade
  Model (CICM) that incorporates competitive influences propagating simultaneously
  across multiple platforms. A greedy algorithm is proposed for effective seed node
  selection under this competitive scenario, validated through extensive experiments
  on both real-world and synthetic datasets. Results demonstrate that our model and
  algorithm significantly outperform traditional approaches, highlighting the necessity
  and effectiveness of modeling competitive propagation dynamics across multiple social
  networks."
