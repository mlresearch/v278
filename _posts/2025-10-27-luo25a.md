title: 'YOLOv5n-ShuffleNetv2: A Lightweight Transmission Line Insulator Defect Detection
  Algorithm'
abstract: Insulators represent a pivotal component of transmission lines, with their
  functionality directly impacting the reliable operation of the power grid. Current
  insulator defect detection algorithms face significant challenges, including low
  accuracy and long latency, which hinder their practical application in the timely
  and reliable maintenance of power systems. Therefore, this paper proposed a lightweight
  detector to minimize the model’s parameters and calculations. First, the YOLOv5n
  algorithm was chosen as the foundation for the detection system’s lightweight design.
  Second, the ShuffleNetv2 backbone replaced the YOLOv5n backbone to further lightweight
  the model. Experimental results showed that the proposed YOLOv5n-ShuffleNetv2 model
  achieved 84.5% mAP50 at 87.7 FPS using the Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano 4G. Although
  the accuracy decreased by 4.1%, the model achieved a 44.7% reduction in the number
  of parameters and a 22% increase in detection speed, demonstrating a significant
  improvement in efficiency and practicality.
