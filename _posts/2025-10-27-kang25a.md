title: Few-Shot Object Detection via  Decoupled and Balanced Contrastive Learning
abstract: Abstract. Only a few training examples are used for object detection task,
  and The productivity of the neural network model will show a dramatic decrease.
  Countless approaches to few-shot object detection (FSOD) have been formulated to
  solve the problem with a fine-tuning mechanism. Whereas those methods usually result
  in misclassification of novel classes and are biased in favor of base classes. For
  coping with this problem, we advance a fine-tuning learning framework with decoupled
  and balanced contrastive schemes(FSDB). More precisely, we first incorporate supervised
  contrastive learning with a decoupled loss to obtain a more outstanding performance
  for novel classes. Based on the decoupled supervised contrastive learning, we  then
  put forward a class-balanced learning technique to resolve the issue of unequal
  sample distribution of base and new classes in the fine-tuning procedure. Rigorous
  experiments conducted on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets indicate that the presented
  technique has obtained excellent results for FSOD tasks.
