title: An optimization problem Based on Integer Programming Theory
abstract: With the implementation of the rural revitalization strategy, promoting
  high-quality rural development has become a strategic requirement. A key challenge
  in optimizing rural development is achieving high-quality agricultural cultivation.
  Given fixed arable land areas and seed quality, determining optimal crop planting
  strategies is a critical research focus. This study takes a village in North Chinaâ€™s
  mountainous region as an example, incorporating local land types, suitable crops,
  terrain areas, and infrastructure (traditional greenhouses and smart greenhouses).
  First, land is classified based on given data. Second, yields, planting costs, and
  sales prices of the same crop across different terrains are analyzed, with median
  prices used for profit comparisons. Finally, using integer programming principles
  and intelligent software, an optimal planting strategy for 2024 is proposed through
  yield models, planting area models, and maximum revenue models.
