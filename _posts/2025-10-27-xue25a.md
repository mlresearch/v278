title: FRE-Based Sparrow Search Algorithm for Green Flexible Job Shop Scheduling
abstract: The modern manufacturing is facing the challenge of energy saving and emission
  reduction. This study addresses the Multi-objective Green Flexible Job-shop Scheduling
  Problem (MGFJSP) with three objectives makespan, machine workload and carbon emissions,
  a Fuzzy Relative Entropy (FRE)-based improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (FISSA) is
  proposed. FISSA begins with special initialize methods to ensure a uniform distribution
  in solution space. Next, a logarithmic spiral is introduced in scroungers to enhance
  global search capability. Additionally, an insertion strategy is implemented to
  reduce machine idle time and carbon emissions. Finally, a FRE coefficient is introduced,
  where solutions are evaluated by comparing them with the ideal point, diversity
  is quantified, and selection is guided. Experimental results confirm that FISSA
  outperforms other multi-objective algorithms, significantly minimizing processing
  time and carbon emissions, demonstrate superior robustness and convergence.
