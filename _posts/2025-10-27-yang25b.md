title: 'YOLOv5n-MobileNetv4: A Lightweight Crop Pest Detection Algorithm'
abstract: Pests significantly impact crop quality and yield, making their management
  crucial for agriculture. The real-time and accurate identification of agricultural
  pests is essential for implementing effective pest control measures, ensuring timely
  intervention, and minimizing crop losses. Existing pest detection systems face challenges
  such as low accuracy and excessive parameters, which hinder their efficiency and
  practicality in real-world applications. Therefore, this paper proposed a real-time
  pest detector for embedded devices by combining the state-of-the-art mobile device-based
  MobileNetv4 and lightweight You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5n object detection algorithms,
  achieving high efficiency and performance. The proposed YOLOv5n-MobileNetv4 model
  replaced the YOLOv5n backbone with the MobileNetv4 backbone, effectively reducing
  parameters while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experimental results showed
  that the improved model achieved 82.1% mAP50 at 87.7 frames per second (FPS). It
  achieved a 36.2% reduction in parameters and a 31.1% increase in speed, with a slight
  accuracy drop.
