title: Directional Risk-Averse Integrated Loss Strategy for Time Series
abstract: This study focuses on time series forecasting for risk-averse decision-makers,
  emphasizing trend direction over precise numerical predictions. Traditional methods
  like MSE fail to capture directional accuracy, which is crucial for risk-averse
  decisions. While techniques like DILATE improve time alignment, they still rely
  on numerical metrics. We introduce DRAILS (Directional Risk-Averse Integrated Loss
  Strategy for time series), a novel loss function that prioritizes directional accuracy
  while maintaining numerical precision. By incorporating a dynamic reward-penalty
  system inspired by the newsvendor model, DRAILS minimizes directional errors. Our
  experiments have shown that DRAILS outperforms existing methods in directional accuracy
  while maintaining competitive numerical results.
