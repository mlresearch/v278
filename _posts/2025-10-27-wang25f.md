title: Optimized YOLOv8 Model for Aerial Pedestrian Detection in Drone-Based Monitoring
  Systems
abstract: The widespread application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in emergency
  rescue and security inspection poses stringent demands for accuracy and real-time
  performance in small-target personnel detection from aerial perspectives. Addressing
  the limitations of existing algorithms in complex background interference, multi-scale
  targets, and feature sparsity, this paper proposes an improved lightweight YOLOv8
  detection model. By designing a multi-dimensional attention collaboration module
  to enhance feature focus, constructing a high-resolution detection layer to improve
  shallow feature utilization, and optimizing localization accuracy with geometrically
  constrained loss functions, the method achieves an 11.68% detection accuracy improvement
  over the baseline model on UAV datasets while maintaining real-time processing at
  158 FPS. It effectively resolves small-target missed and false detection issues,
  providing reliable technical support for UAV-based intelligent inspection tasks.
