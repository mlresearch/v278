title: Research on interpretable methods for detecting elongated objects in power
  operations
abstract: '  Power operations take place in high-risk environments, such as high voltage
  and strong magnetic fields, making standardized procedures crucial. Employing object
  detection technology to monitor operational compliance enhances electrical safety.
  However, the presence of numerous elongated objects and background columnar interferences
  in power operation datasets significantly affects detection accuracy. To address
  this issue, we explore model structure improvements from an interpretability perspective.
  Using Grad-CAM heatmap visualization, we analyze the regions where the model focuses
  on detection targets. We propose a lightweight convolutional attention mechanism,
  LCA (Lightweight Convolution Attention), which significantly enhances YOLOv7’s attention
  to elongated targets while reducing the impact of columnar interference. This improves
  both the model’s robustness and interpretability. Experimental results show that
  LCA outperforms classical attention modules such as SE, ECA, and CA, while maintaining
  a minimal parameter size. Specifically, the mAP of the extremely elongated and challenging
  sample “operatingbar" increased by 4.4%, and the mAP of the small target “wrongglove"
  improved by approximately 2%. This makes LCA well-suited for detecting elongated
  targets in complex power operation environments. '
