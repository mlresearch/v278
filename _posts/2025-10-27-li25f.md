title: 'DCRes2Net: Enhanced Res2Net with Dimensional Feature Fusion for Speaker Verification'
abstract: Many classical convolutional architectures have been introduced to the field
  of speaker verification; however, solely employing one-dimensional or two-dimensional
  convolutions is insufficient for efficiently modeling speaker features. To address
  this limitation, this paper introduces a multi-dimensional feature fusion strategy
  and presents an enhanced Res2Net architecture based on dimensional feature fusion.
  Different feature modeling techniques complement each other, fully leveraging their
  respective advantages in temporal and spatial feature extraction to achieve comprehensive
  representation of multi-dimensional data. Experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb
  dataset demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves competitive performance
  along with robust generalizability.
