title: 'HD-MF: Hierarchical Dynamic-aware Multimodal Fusion for Fine-Grained Bird
  Recognition'
abstract: Fine-grained bird recognition plays a crucial role in biodiversity monitoring.
  Its primary challenge lies in identifying subtle inter-class visual differences
  and overcoming the inherent limitations of unimodal information. Audio provides
  crucial complementary cues, yet audiovisual fusion still faces challenges such as
  the semantic gap. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a hierarchical
  dynamic-aware multimodal fusion (HD-MF) architecture. This architecture captures
  locally aligned cross-modal features via its Cross-modal Spatial Interaction Module,
  extracts global high-order cross-modal correlations using the Factorized Bilinear
  Fusion Module, and dynamically integrates the outputs of these two fusion approaches
  through a Dynamically Adaptive Gated Fusion Unit. Evaluated on AViS, a paired audiovisual
  dataset constructed for this study, HD-MF achieved state-of-the-art performance.
  Experimental results demonstrated that HD-MF effectively integrates audiovisual
  complementary information, providing a novel and effective approach for enhancing
  fine-grained bird recognition performance.
