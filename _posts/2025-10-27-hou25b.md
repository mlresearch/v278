title: 'Forest to Agriculture: Based on The Lotka-Volterra Ecosystem Model'
abstract: As people’s demand for land continues to grow, large areas of land have
  been reclaimed for agricultural production. As forests recede and soils change,
  chemicals begin to appear on farmland, and the original ecological relationships
  in the forest gradually evolve into a food chain driven by human activity. In this
  article, we established an agricultural ecological model based on Lotka-Volterra
  to analyze the interactions between different biological populations. First, We
  construct the Lotka-Volterra model based on the producer and multi-stage consumer
  model, determine how different species are related to each other. Second, we introduce
  decomposers and peregrine falcons (tertiary consumers) into the model to reflect
  the reappearance of species. We derive the corresponding equations and use the fourth-order
  Runge-Kutta method to calculate each population’s rate of change. Third, we added
  bats to the food web model and considered their role in insect hunting and pollination
  to analyze their impact. Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the model,
  changing four survival conditions. For a given range of data, the number of organism
  populations eventually plateaued. This validates the sensitivity of the model and
  confirms the stability of organic agro-ecology.
