title: Reinforcement Learning Based Collaborative Path Planning Research for UAVs
  and Unmanned Vehicles
abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for multi-UAV and
  UGV coordinated path planning with charging constraints. We formulate the problem
  as a Markov Decision Process and develop a Transformer-based solution combining
  encoder-decoder architecture with policy gradients to optimize path synchronization
  and charging coordination. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
  existing heuristic methods (GLS, TS) in terms of solution quality and generalization
  across different problem scales. The proposed method effectively minimizes mission
  completion time while handling energy constraints through intelligent charging point
  synchronization.
