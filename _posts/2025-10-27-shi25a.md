title: Design and Implementation of Lightweight Fitness System Based on Mediapipe
  Framework
abstract: With the development of the social economy, people are paying increasing
  attention to personal health and regard fitness as an essential way to improve physical
  quality. However, China has a large population and cannot provide high-quality physical
  education for everyone, facing enormous logistical and resource challenges. Therefore,
  this study designed a lightweight, intelligent fitness system based on Mediapipe
  and OpenCV, which offers high adaptability, portability, and a lightweight design,
  particularly for micro mobile devices. The system can provide users with more convenient,
  personalized, and efficient training methods. This paper offers an in-depth introduction
  to the functional framework and development details of the system and conducts functional
  testing and comparison. According to the experimental results, the system shows
  good performance, stable operation, and high recognition rate, achieving the expected
  experimental goal.
