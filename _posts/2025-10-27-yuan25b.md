title: Equivalent Modelling and Simulation Method for 2.5D Chips Based on Machine
  Learning and Multi-Physics Field Coupling
abstract: Aiming at the problems of low computational efficiency and high resource
  consumption of traditional finite element simulation owing to complex structures
  such as through-silicon vias (TSVs) and bumps in 2.5D chip packages, this paper
  proposes an intelligent equivalent modelling and simulation optimization method
  that integrates machine learning and multi-physics field coupling. By constructing
  a dynamic equivalent model adaptive mechanism and adjusting the material parameters
  in real time based on deep neural network to capture the temperature-stress coupling
  effect; combining with the multi-scale geometry simplification technology, the deep
  learning is used to identify the key regions and differentially assign the modelling
  accuracy, which reduces the overall mesh number by 50% while ensuring the refined
  simulation of key regions (e.g., heat-sensitive and stress-concentrated regions).
  Dynamic model reconstruction and real-time optimization under multi-physics field
  coupling are further achieved through the integration of sensor data and simulation
  feedback. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional finite
  element method, the method shortens the simulation time by more than 30%, reduces
  the memory consumption by 50%, reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the
  temperature field by 2.8$^\circ$C, and controls the maximum error of the stress
  field within 4.8%, which significantly improves the multi-physics simulation efficiency
  and accuracy of the complex 2.5D chip package and provides a highly efficient and
  reliable solution for the design optimization of high-density integrated chips.
