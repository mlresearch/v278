title: Underwater Object Detection via Structural Pruning of YOLOv7
abstract: 'This study addresses the challenge of deploying object detection models
  in resource-constrained underwater environments by optimizing YOLOv7 through pruning
  techniques.Underwater detection faces limitations due to low-light conditions, water
  turbidity, and mobile device constraints.The proposed method applies channel pruning
  to YOLOv7, strategically removing low-weight channels to reduce computational load
  and parameter count while maintaining accuracy.Comparative experiments evaluated
  pruning rates (0%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 80%) on the UPRC dataset, focusing on sea
  urchins, scallops, sea cucumbers, and starfish.Results showed that a 50% pruning
  rate achieved optimal balance: mAP increased by 2.3% (from 83.8% to 85.7%), while
  parameters and computations reduced to one-fourth of original values.'
