title: Road Sign Detection in Extreme Weather Conditions
abstract: In road traffic sign detection, the low detection precision of road traffic
  signs in the detection screen is attributed to their small proportion and adverse
  weather conditions, such as fog, snow, and nighttime. To enhance the detection precision
  of road signs in extreme weather, this paper proposes an algorithm based on a lightweight
  improvement of YOLOv8n, referred to as FRPP-YOLOv8n (FFA-Net-RFAConv-PSA-P2-YOLOv8n).
  Firstly, the improved lightweight FFA-Net module is incorporated to dehaze the images.
  Secondly, RFAConv (Receptive-Field Attention convolutional operation) is introduced
  to enhance network performance. The PSA (Partial self-attention) mechanism is employed
  to improve detection precision, and finally, a small target detection layer is added
  to enhance the detection precision of small targets. The experimental results indicate
  that the improved algorithm achieves 53.4% mAP50-95 and 82.1% mAP50 on the CCTSDB2021
  traffic sign dataset, which is an increase of 4.5% for both metrics compared to
  the original algorithm. Additionally, it maintains a high precision rate of 91.3%,
  representing a 4% improvement over the original algorithm.
