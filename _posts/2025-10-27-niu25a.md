title: 'R-PBFT: Efficient DAG-based consensus Algorithm for Internet of Vehicles'
abstract: With the increase in the number of vehicles in residential households, the
  traffic flow on roads has shown a significant growth trend, which places higher
  demands on the capacity of vehicular networks. It is worth noting that the traditional
  PBFT algorithm experiences a significant decline in consensus efficiency as the
  number of nodes increases, which may pose a key constraint on the information exchange
  efficiency in vehicular networks. Based on this, this study proposes an R-PBFT consensus
  algorithm based on DAG blockchain. This algorithm optimizes the consensus mechanism
  and significantly improves the information transmission rate between roadside units
  and vehicles. Experimental results show that, compared to traditional consensus
  algorithms, the proposed solution effectively improves consensus efficiency while
  reducing communication costs.
