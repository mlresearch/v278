title: A Knowledge Augmented Framework for Multimodal News\{Object-Entity Relation
  Extraction
abstract: Multimodal relation extraction, as an important research direction in the
  field of information extraction, aims to identify entities and objects from both
  text and images and establish cross-modal semantic associations. Current mainstream
  methods still face challenges in handling complex multimodal data, such as semantic
  alignment confusion and redundant associations, which lead to erroneous associations
  between irrelevant entities and objects, severely affecting system performance.
  To address this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal relation extraction framework
  that integrates knowledge graphs. This approach uses the knowledge graph as external
  semantic support to filter candidate entity-object pairs through structured semantic
  information, and leverages a multimodal alignment module to achieve precise semantic
  matching. Experimental results show that this method significantly outperforms existing
  methods on multiple benchmark datasets, especially in fine-grained relation recognition,
  where the F1 score increases by 4 percentage points, effectively demonstrating the
  frameworkâ€™s ability to mitigate cross-modal noise interference.
