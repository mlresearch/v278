title: 'Trust-Region Bayesian Optimization for High-Dimensional Black-Box Problems:
  Integrating Deep Kernel Learning with Adaptive Gradient Mechanisms'
abstract: The traditional Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm faces significant performance
  bottlenecks when addressing high-dimensional black-box optimization problems. To
  mitigate this challenge, the present paper introduces a novel trust region Bayesian
  optimization algorithm. Firstly, in the design of the BO surrogate model, we employ
  a combination of deep neural networks and kernel methods to enhance the Gaussian
  process regression (GPR) model. This approach improves GPR’s capacity to identify
  and fit the nonlinear characteristics of black-box functions while also increasing
  regression accuracy. Secondly, in formulating the BO acquisition function, an adaptive
  gradient trust region adjustment method is utilized to bolster BO’s search capabilities
  within high-dimensional solution spaces. Concurrently, a hybrid sampling strategy
  is implemented to generate more diverse sampling points, thereby enhancing BO’s
  ability to escape local optima. The proposed algorithm has been validated on three
  60D multimodal complex functions as well as two engineering application problems
  and compared with other advanced variants of BO. Experimental results demonstrate
  that our proposed algorithm exhibits superior iterative convergence, rapidly approaches
  optimal values for black-box problems with fewer function evaluations, and achieves
  higher computational accuracy. These findings confirm both the feasibility and effectiveness
  of the improved BO approach presented in this paper.
