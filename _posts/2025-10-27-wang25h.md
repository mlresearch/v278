title: Study on Time-Sensitive Targets Strike Path Planning Based on Improved Crayfish
  Optimization Algorithm
abstract: Addressing the challenges of complex solution and low accuracy in time-sensitive
  targets strike path planning, this paper proposes a novel path planning method which,
  based on the Open Vehicle Path Problem (OVRP), builds a model and applies the Improved
  Crayfish Optimization Algorithm (ICOA) to solving it. Relative to the initial Crayfish
  Optimization Algorithm (COA), the ICOA employs an improved strategy, namely “Chaos
  Accumulation-Environment Awareness-Lens Imaging” to markedly enhance the optimization
  efficiency and robustness of the algorithm and, through integer coding and crossover
  operation, is integrated with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and innovatively applied
  to addressing the OVRPs. The experimental results demonstrate that ICOA exhibits
  better convergence speed and optimization accuracy over the other algorithms in
  composite optimization, displays enhanced robustness, and is capable of rapidly
  generating a path planning scheme with a shorter total flight distance in the OVRP
  model, further verifying the effectiveness of ICOA in solving the OVRPs.
