title: 'MEFN: A Multi-scale Entropy-aware Fusion Network For Image-Text Retrieval'
abstract: 'Image-Text Retrieval(ITR), a crucial task in multi-modal learning, aims
  to achieve cross-modal information retrieval through semantic alignment and matching
  between images and text. With the advancement of deep learning, significant progress
  has been made in the accuracy and efficiency of ITR methods. However, existing approaches
  still face challenges such as modality heterogeneity, information redundancy, and
  insufficient multi-scale feature alignment between images and text. To address these
  issues, this paper proposes an Image-Text Retrieval method based on a Multi-scale
  Entropy-aware Fusion Network (MEFN). By introducing entropy-aware modeling and multi-scale
  attention mechanisms, this method enhances the correlation between image and text
  features, further improving cross-modal semantic matching capabilities. Specifically,
  MEFN first guides the fusion of image and text features through an entropy-aware
  model, then finely models multi-scale features using local and global attention
  mechanisms to generate efficient image-text fusion representations. Experimental
  results demonstrate that MEFN significantly improves the accuracy and robustness
  of image-text retrieval compared to mainstream methods on benchmark datasets such
  as Flickr30K and MSCOCO, especially showing superior performance in fine-grained
  object matching and complex scenarios. This study provides a new perspective for
  image-text retrieval methods and holds promise for further applications in multi-lingual
  image-text retrieval and video-text retrieval fields. '
