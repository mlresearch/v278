title: A Hybrid XGBoost and Stacked Regression Model with Optimized Feature Selection
  for Port Throughput Prediction
abstract: The prediction of port throughput is very important for port operation management.
  Aiming at the prediction of port throughput, this study selected the level of economic
  and trade and development vitality in the hinterland, regional transportation capacity
  in the hinterland, port infrastructure conditions and other first-class indicators
  and 13 second-class indicators, used xgboost to analyze the importance of characteristics,
  and screened out 9 key influencing factors. The combined model based on xgboost
  and stacking algorithm was constructed, and the parameters were optimized by cross
  validation and grid search method. Taking Dalian port as an example, the experiment
  shows that when xgboost stacking model is used to predict port throughput, MAE,
  MAPE and RMSE are the lowest, and $R^2$ is the highest. The prediction performance
  is significantly better than other models, which verifies the effectiveness and
  superiority of the model in port throughput prediction, and provides a new method
  and idea for port throughput prediction.
