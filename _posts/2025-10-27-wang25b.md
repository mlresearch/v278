title: A Visual SLAM Algorithm for Indoor Dynamic Scenes Based on Semantic Feature
  Screening
abstract: This study innovatively proposes a dynamic scene SLAM al- gorithm that integrates
  semantic feature filtering mechanism to address the problems of large positioning
  deviation and dense map artifacts in visual SLAM systems in indoor dynamic environments.
  In the track- ing module of the ORB-SLAM3 framework, this algorithm introduces a
  lightweight YOLOv11-seg neural network for scene semantic analysis and target area
  calibration. Through semantic information, depth data, and geometric relationships,
  feature point motion state discrimination is achieved, and a high-precision dynamic
  feature filtering algorithm is developed. To verify the performance of the algorithm,
  benchmark tests were conducted on the TUM dataset of the Technical University of
  Mu- nich. Comparative experimental data showed that in the high dynamic conditions
  of the TUM testing scenario, this scheme achieved significant improvement in trajectory
  tracking accuracy, and its positioning per- formance was significantly better than
  the current mainstream dynamic SLAM technology.
