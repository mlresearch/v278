title: 'Enhancing Robustness in Multi-Step Reasoning: A Synergistic Approach Combining
  Planning with Reflective Self-Correction'
abstract: 'Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced complex problem-solving
  capabilities by incorporating extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
  managing error propagation over long inference chains remains a critical challenge.
  In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named \textbf{P}lanning
  and \textbf{Re}flective \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{C}orrection that integrates two complementary
  mechanisms: planning phase and reflection phase. The planning phase decomposes complex
  queries into streaming sub-problems and generates detailed reasoning trajectories,
  while the reflection phase leverages corrective feedback from erroneous outputs
  to refine these trajectories. The datasets sampled through these two mechanisms
  are used for self-supervised training, further reinforcing the LLM’s reasoning capabilities.
  Experiments conducted on the multi-hop Question Answering dataset demonstrate that
  our approach enhances the model’s ability to generate coherent and accurate reasoning
  paths. Ablation studies further reveal the distinct contributions of planning and
  reflection to the overall performance. Our results suggest that integrating anticipatory
  planning with reflective self-correction provides a promising avenue for robust
  long-range inference in LRMs.'
