title: Self-Supervised Learning of ECG and PPG Signals for Multi-Modal Health Monitoring
abstract: 'Self-supervised multimodal time-series analysis faces critical challenges
  including cross-domain temporal shifts, sensor noise, and inter-subject variability,
  which degrade disease classification performance. Existing methods often depend
  on labeled data or explicit target domain alignment, limiting their clinical practicality.
  We propose TSTA-Net, a novel framework that integrates: (1) a residual spatiotemporal
  transformer (STN) to dynamically correct sensor shifts and motion artifacts, (2)
  a dual-branch Transformer for capturing long-range dependencies, and (3) hierarchical
  contrastive learning for spatiotemporal alignment of ECG and PPG signals. This integrated
  approach addresses both temporal dynamics and spatial inconsistencies through joint
  optimization. On atrial fibrillation detection, TSTA-Net achieves a 9.3% higher
  F1-score than state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, with ablation studies verifying
  that the spatiotemporal alignment mechanism contributes 68% of the performance gain.
  The lightweight framework ($<$1M parameters) reduces annotation dependency while
  enabling real-time arrhythmia screening on wearable devices, advancing self-supervised
  learning for practical healthcare applications.'
