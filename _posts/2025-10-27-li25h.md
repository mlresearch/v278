title: Study on Wavelet Convolution-Based Underwater Image Denoising
abstract: The processing of underwater images is critical for marine science, seafloor
  mapping, and underwater rescue operations. However, underwater optical images often
  suffer from poor quality due to light absorption and scattering caused by suspended
  particles. Additionally, due to technical limitations and environmental interference,
  underwater robots often capture images where light has been reflected and refracted
  multiple times before reaching the camera, further exacerbating noise. To address
  these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative underwater image processing
  model that combines wavelet convolution and dilated convolution for noise reduction.
  The model employs wavelet transformation to decompose images into high- and low-frequency
  components for preliminary processing, followed by the use of dilated convolution
  to extract noise and image features. This approach effectively removes noise from
  underwater images. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can adaptively
  handle illumination and detail information across different scales, addressing challenges
  such as uneven lighting, low contrast color distortion, and suspended particle noise.
  The processed images exhibit significantly improved clarity and contrast, even in
  complex underwater environments.
