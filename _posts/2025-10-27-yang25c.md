title: Analysis of Learning Factors and Academic Performance of Non-Elite Students
  Using Machine Learning Models
abstract: This study applies machine learning models, including logistic regression,
  random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost, to analyze and predict
  the final grades of non-elite university science students. The data includes attendance,
  note-taking scores, homework scores, quiz scores, and screen-cutting behavior. The
  results indicate that quiz scores, homework scores, and note-taking scores are the
  key factors for predicting final grades, with a particular impact from mid-term
  and pre-final quiz scores. SVM performs well in predicting students at risk of failing,
  while random forest and XGBoost show stronger stability in handling complex data.
  Analysis of the importance analysis reveals that studentsâ€™ engagement, such as quiz
  and homework scores, is strongly correlated with final grades. The findings suggest
  that machine learning can effectively identify students at academic risk, providing
  data support for educational interventions. Future research could integrate more
  student behavior data and sentiment analysis to further improve prediction accuracy.
