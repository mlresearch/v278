title: 6D Pose Estimation of Camera Based on the Fusion of Checkerboard and ICP Algorithm
abstract: Nowadays, camera pose estimation, as a core technology in the field of 3D
  vision, plays a crucial role in various applications such as autonomous driving.
  This paper presents a camera pose estimation method that combines checkerboard pattern
  and ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm. Based on the chessboard calibration
  plate captured by the mobile camera, by extracting two-dimensional feature points
  through pixel-level corner detection and then performing sub-pixel optimization
  on the feature points, and then precisely matched with the three-dimensional point
  cloud data obtained by the Gemini2 depth camera. A registration model based on the
  ICP algorithm is constructed to simultaneously solve the rotation matrix and translation
  vector of the camera. The experimental results demonstrate that this method exhibits
  high accuracy and achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0109 and the fitness
  is 1. By merely utilizing 40 key feature points (derived from an 8$\times$5 checkerboard),
  this method reduces the computational load, enables ICP to converge within 40 iterations,
  and enhances the real-time efficiency.
