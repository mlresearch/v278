title: Review of Research on Artificial Intelligence-Based Carbon Emission Prediction
abstract: 'Under the global climate governance framework, carbon emission prediction
  has emerged as a pivotal technology for low-carbon energy transition. This review
  systematically examines the advancements in artificial intelligence-based carbon
  emission forecasting, revealing the evolutionary dynamics between traditional statistical
  methods and data-driven models. A novel “data-model-scenario" triadic analytical
  framework is proposed to deconstruct core challenges in this field. The study demonstrates
  that conventional approaches (e.g., ARIMA, grey models) exhibit structural deficiencies
  in high renewable energy penetration scenarios, including poor adaptability to abrupt
  changes and low cross-source data integration efficiency ($<$60%). In contrast,
  data-driven methods (XGBoost, LSTM, Transformer) achieve significant accuracy improvements
  through dynamic modeling and feature decoupling. Hybrid paradigms integrating physical
  constraints and multimodal alignment show promise in bridging the mechanism-data
  gap, yet face persistent challenges: inefficient multi-source data fusion (feature
  alignment success rate $<$60%), delayed response to sudden scenarios (recovery time
  $>$30 minutes), and computational-precision tradeoffs in edge deployment. The paper
  proposes a “dual-driven" evolutionary path for hybrid modeling and constructs a
  multi-scale scenario linkage matrix, providing theoretical guidance for next-generation
  prediction frameworks. Emerging technologies such as digital twins and federated
  meta-learning are highlighted as critical directions for future research.'
