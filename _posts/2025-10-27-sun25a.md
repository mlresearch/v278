title: EfficientNetV2 Pump Anomaly Detection Method Based on Improved CBAM Attention
  Mechanism
abstract: 'In the process of industrial production, pump as the core equipment, its
  stable operation directly affects the safety and production efficiency of the factory.
  However, in practical applications, pumps often face various abnormal conditions,
  which may lead to equipment failure and even safety accidents in serious cases.
  To solve this problem, we design a new anomaly detection method, which improves
  the EfficientNetV2 network: The original Attention Module is replaced with the optimized
  CBAM module, its channel attention is retained to capture the cross-channel dependencies,
  and the Simple Attention Module (SimAM) is introduced into the spatial attention
  part to effectively reduce the computational complexity and enhance the sensitivity
  of the model to local details and global context information. In order to better
  deal with the problem of data imbalance, we use MixUp data augmentation and Label
  Smoothing regularization strategy in the training process, and choose BCEWithLogitsLoss
  as the loss function. In the pre-training phase, the pump-related audio modules
  in the MIMII dataset are used for weight initialization, which is subsequently fine-tuned
  on the pump anomaly binary classification task. Experimental results show that the
  proposed model improves the classification accuracy by 0.76% compared with the original
  EfficientNetV2-Small network under the same data set and evaluation metrics, which
  verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the architecture optimization in pump
  anomaly detection. '
