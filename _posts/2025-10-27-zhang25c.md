title: Event-Based Binary Neural Networks for Efficient and Accurate Lip Reading
abstract: Event cameras provide exceptional temporal resolution and consume minimal
  power, making them highly suitable for lip reading tasks. However, traditional methods
  struggle with the high computational costs of processing asynchronous event streams.
  We propose STCNet, a spatio-temporal convolutional network optimized for event-driven
  lip reading, and its binary counterpart B-STCNet,which results in a substantial
  reduction in computational and memory resource requirements. B-STCNet introduces
  Kernel-Specific Scaling Factors to bridge the performance gap induced by binarization
  and adopts quantization-aware training to enhance model stability. Evaluated on
  the DVS-Lip dataset, B-STCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with over 90% reduction
  in parameters and 50% fewer FLOPs, demonstrating its potential for deployment on
  resource-constrained edge devices.
