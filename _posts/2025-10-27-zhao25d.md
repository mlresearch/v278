title: A Functional Area Layout Model of Agricultural Products Logistics Park Based
  on PSO Algorithm
abstract: This paper proposes a functional area layout model for an agricultural products
  logistics park based on particle swarm optimization ( PSO ). Targeting the the layout
  planning of an agricultural products logistics park in C County, a multi-objective
  planning model is established ,considering the total material handling cost, land
  area utilization rate, and the comprehensive correlation of functional areas. The
  PSO algorithm is employed to solve the model and obtain the optimal layout scheme.
  Through field research and data analysis, the validity and practicability of the
  model are verified. The results indicate that the model can significantly enhance
  the operational efficiency and service quality of agricultural products logistics
  parks, reduce logistics costs, and promote the sustainable development of the agricultural
  products logistics industry.
