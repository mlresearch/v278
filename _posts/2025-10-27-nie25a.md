title: 'A Review of Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition: Methods, Datasets and Directions'
abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) has emerged as an essential
  area of research in computer vision, with implications in human-computer interaction,
  psychological analysis, and security. Although image-based static facial expression
  recognition (SFER) is well-developed, DFER captures temporal dynamics, remains less
  explored. This paper comprehensively reviews DFER, focusing on feature extraction
  methods from traditional handcrafted features to advanced deep learning techniques,
  analyzing performance metrics, and examining publicly available datasets with their
  comparative characteristics. We discuss specific challenges faced by DFER systems
  such as occlusion, pose variations, and temporal alignment. Finally, we explore
  promising applications in healthcare and human-computer interaction, providing concrete
  implementation strategies and future research directions.
