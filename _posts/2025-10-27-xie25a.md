title: A Comparative Study of Several Different Neural Network Approaches for Information
  Security Modeling
abstract: In the rapid development of the Internet, peopleâ€™s lives have been deeply
  bound to the Internet, and the network information data is explosive growth. However,
  along with it, there is an increasingly serious problem of network information security.
  In order to achieve more accurate network information security classification judgment,
  we use BP neural network, RBF neural network, based on genetic algorithm optimization
  of RBF neural network three models to compare the information security model respectively,
  used to assess their ability to assess the information security risk (threatening,
  vulnerability, asset identification). The experimental results show that the RBF
  neural network optimized based on genetic algorithm has higher accuracy and lower
  error in information security risk assessment, which has significant advantages
  over the traditional neural network and provides a strong basis for improving the
  level of information security protection and selecting the best neural network model.
