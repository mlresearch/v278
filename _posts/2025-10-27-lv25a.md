title: Semi-Supervised L2KC (S-L2KC) Classifier
abstract: Building upon the density difference paradigm, a novel kernel classifier
  distinct from Support Vector Machines (SVM) — the L2-norm Kernel Classifier (L2KC)
  — has been developed. This methodology establishes an integrated squared error(ISE)
  criterion to estimate the true ${{d}_{\gamma }}\left( x \right) $ through minimizing
  the L2-distance between ${{d}_{\gamma }}\left( x \right) $ and ${{\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\frown}{d}}_{\gamma
  }}\left( x \right) $, thereby achieving classification via explicit density difference
  representation. While L2KC demonstrates comparable accuracy to SVM with enhanced
  decision efficiency, its performance on real-world semi-supervised datasets requires
  improvement. To address this limitation, we propose the Semi-supervised L2KC (S-L2KC)
  by incorporating a locality-preserving projection (LPP) based manifold regularization
  term into the L2KC objective function. This integration effectively enforces the
  manifold assumption. Experimental results on benchmark datasets from the UCI and
  LIBSVM demonstrate that compared to L2KC, the proposed S-L2KC exhibits superior
  generalization capability, characterized by higher mean test accuracy with comparable
  or even smaller variance.
