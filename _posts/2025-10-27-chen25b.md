title: 'Urat: Universal regularized adversarial training in robust reinforcement learning'
abstract: With the increasing maturity of reinforcement learning (RL)technology, its
  application areas have been widely expanded to several cutting-edge scientific fields,
  such as artificial intelligence, robotics, intelligent manufacturing, self-driving
  cars, and cognitive computing. However, the complexity and uncertainty of the real
  world pose serious challenges to the stability of RL models. For example, in the
  field of autonomous driving, unpredictable road conditions and variable weather
  conditions can adversely affect the decision-making process of intelligent driving
  algorithms, leading them to make irrational decisions. To address this problem,
  this study proposes a training method called Universal Regularized Adversarial Training
  in Robust Reinforcement Learning (Urat), which aims to enhance the robustness of
  the robustness of DRL strategies against potential adversarial attacks. In this
  study, we introduce a powerful attacker for targeted adversarial training of DRL
  intelligence. In addition, we innovatively incorporate a robust strategy regularizer
  into the algorithm to facilitate the learning of strategies by intelligences that
  can effectively defend against various attacks. The methods in this study have been
  tested adversarially in several OpenAI Gym  environments, including  HalfCheetah-v4,
  Swimmer-v4, and  Arcbot-vl.The  test  results show that the Urat training method
  can effectively improve the robustness of DRL strategies and achieve robust performance
  in complex and uncertain environments. This research result not only provides a
  new perspective in the field of reinforcement learning but also provides theoretical
  support and technical guarantee for intelligent decision-making in practical application
  scenarios such as autonomous driving.
