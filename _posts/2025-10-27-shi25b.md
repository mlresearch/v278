title: Local Hurst index timing strategy
abstract: This paper proposes a technical analysis strategy based on the Hurst index
  to predict stock price trends in uncertain markets. As a robust timing tool requiring
  minimal assumptions, the Hurst index effectively captures market memory effects.
  We apply this method to the CSI 300, mathematically analyze its properties, and
  empirically validate its profitability.
