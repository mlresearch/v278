title: 'DCMTrack: Rethinking the Motion for Vehicle Multi-Object Tracking'
abstract: Vehicle multi-object tracking has significant applications in many fields.
  Existing methods struggle to address the challenges of nonlinear motion and prolonged
  occlusion in vehicle tracking. In this paper, an advanced tracker featuring a Nonlinear
  Noise Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter, namely DCMTrack, is designed to finely adjust
  measurement noise and significantly enhance the accuracy of target motion state
  predictions. An Adaptive Direction and Confidence Cost Matrix is designed to more
  precisely calculate trajectory direction and confidence, enhancing the accuracy
  of target association. Ultimately, a Category-Aware Initialization Mechanism that
  integrates target category and environmental information is proposed to minimize
  false trajectories and optimize the overall trajectory management process. We conducted
  extensive experiments on the VehiclesMOT dataset, validating its effectiveness.
