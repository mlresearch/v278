title: Research on Multi-population Quantum Genetic Algorithm Based on Optimal Computation
  Allocation Technology
abstract: Quantum genetic algorithms have proven their unique superiority in dealing
  with stochastic optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an innovative multi-population
  quantum genetic algorithm, which is based on optimal computational resource allocation
  techniques. By carefully optimizing the initialization strategy of the population
  and introducing the concept of an elite population, combined with optimal computational
  resource allocation techniques, we have significantly improved the performance of
  the algorithm on stochastic optimization problems. After a series of experimental
  verifications, we found that the proposed algorithm surpasses traditional quantum
  genetic algorithms and other classical optimization algorithms in terms of convergence
  speed and solution accuracy.
