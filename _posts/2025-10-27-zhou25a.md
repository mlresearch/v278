title: Explainable Deep Neural Network for Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma Survival Analysis
  by Integrating Genomic and Clinical Data
abstract: we utilized explainable deep learning methodologies to elucidate critical
  genes and prospective biomarkers correlated with the prognosis of Lung Squamous
  Cell Carcinoma (LUSC). Transcriptomic data were systematically acquired from the
  TCGA repository and underwent comprehensive differential expression profiling to
  identify candidate genes warranting in-depth exploration. We developed Cox-PASNet,
  a pathway-aware deep learning model designed to predict survival outcomes in lung
  squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) by integrating multi-modal data, including clinical
  variables, transcriptomic profiles, and curated biological pathways. The model demonstrated
  robust performance, achieving an AUC of 0.73 in stratifying patients into long-
  and short-term survival groups. Beyond predictive accuracy, Cox-PASNet offers interpretable
  insights into key molecular pathways, facilitating the discovery of novel prognostic
  biomarkers (CCDC181, B2M, BTD, C1orf112, ANAPC7) and their related biological pathways
  (regulation of cell cycle, DNA repair, cytoskeletal dynamics, tumor microenvironment,
  and metastasis) associated with LUSC survival. The significance of these genes was
  validated using external datasets and clinical indicators. Notably, members of the
  CCDC family were particularly important, with many found to enhance tumor cell proliferation.
  Elevated expression levels of CCDC proteins demonstrated a significant correlation
  with adverse clinical outcomes, including diminished overall survival rates and
  unfavorable prognosis. In summary, through interpretable deep learning and bioinformatics
  approaches, we identified several relevant genes, with CCDC genes being closely
  linked to LUSC survival.
