title: Research on the Emotional Classification Model of Online Public Opinion Based
  on Complex Contexts
abstract: Under the backdrop of the information explosion and the accelerated pace
  of globalization, online public opinion has become an important channel for reflecting
  social dynamics and public attitudes. With its huge volume of information, rapid
  dissemination, diverse viewpoints and ambiguous correlations, it is difficult for
  traditional sentiment analysis methods to cope with it. This paper aims to construct
  a sentiment analysis model for online public opinion that can adapt to complex contexts.
  By means of the Scrapy crawler framework, the public opinion data about the â€œproblematic
  vaccines" on Sina Weibo is collected. A convolutional neural network situational
  awareness classification model that combines spatial features and word vectors is
  proposed. Firstly, preprocessing is carried out based on the spatial distribution
  characteristics of words in the text. Then, word vectors are constructed based on
  sentiment features. Finally, the model is constructed and trained. Through comparison
  with models such as Linear SVM and CNN+Skip-gram, the results show that this model
  has a certain improvement in both accuracy and recall rate. This paper provides
  more effective decision-making support and theoretical reference for the analysis
  of online public opinion, and realizes the improvement of the sentiment classification
  model in complex contexts.
