title: 'CleanBattack: A Clean-Label Text Backdoor Attack with Limited Information'
abstract: As a new security threat against deep neural networks (DNNS), backdoor attacks
  have been widely studied in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By providing
  poisoned training data, the attacker injects hidden backdoors into the victim model,
  which causes the victim model to behave normally on normal inputs but produce attatter-specified
  malicious outputs on poisoned inputs embedded with special triggers. Backdoor attacks
  that inject data that appears to be labeled correctly to bypass human inspection
  are often referred to as clean label attacks." However, the existing clean label
  attacks have some limitations, such as requiring a high proportion of poisoned samples,
  relying on explicit triggers, or difficult to obtain complete training data. In
  this paper, we propose CleanBattack, a clean label backdoor attack that only requires
  knowledge of the target category of training data, designs precise vectors as triggers,
  and combines synonym replacement to achieve attack injection. The experimental results
  show that the attack success rate of CleanBattack is 6.3%and 15.9%higher than that
  of the baseline, and the clean accuracy rate is 0.8%and 0.9%higher than that of
  the baseline, which proves that the method has significant advantages in concealment
  and effectiveness, expands the application scope of clean label attack, and makes
  existing defense methods have failure risk.
