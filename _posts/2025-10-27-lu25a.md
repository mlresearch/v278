title: Research on Chinese Text Similarity by Fusing Deep and Shallow Features
abstract: Existing Chinese text similarity calculation methods typically focus on
  a single dimension, resulting in insufficient information integration and difficulty
  in comprehensively merging semantic, feature, and structural information. To address
  this issue, a Chinese text similarity calculation model that integrates deep and
  shallow similarities has been proposed. The model first utilizes a Siamese neural
  network to obtain dynamic vector representations of the texts, further extracting
  features and calculating deep semantic similarity. Next, based on traditional edit
  distance algorithms, an improved component-weighted edit distance algorithm is designed
  by introducing tokenization and assigning weights to different parts of speech,
  to more accurately reflect the lexical-level shallow features and structural information
  of the texts. Finally, by linearly weighting and fusing deep semantic similarity
  with shallow feature similarity, a more comprehensive text similarity evaluation
  is achieved. Experimental results show that in experiments based on Chinese STS-B
  and Chinese SICK datasets, the Spearman correlation coefficients improved by 4.34
  and 3.76, respectively, compared to the baseline model Siamese-RoBERTa. This model
  effectively enhances the performance of Chinese short text similarity calculation
  and better aligns with the expression habits of Chinese texts.
