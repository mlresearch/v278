title: 'MUnet-Lite: A Mamba-Based Lightweight Network for Efficient Abdominal Image
  Segmentation'
abstract: The human abdomen houses multiple vital organs, and medical imaging technology
  precisely captures pathological features, providing a foundation for clinical diagnosis
  and treatment. High-precision abdominal image segmentation is crucial for lesion
  localization, organ measurement, and surgical planning. However, existing methods
  face challenges in local feature extraction and multi-scale information modeling.
  To overcome the limitations of Transformer-based approaches, such as insufficient
  local information perception, large model size, and high computational cost, we
  propose MUnet-Lite, a lightweight segmentation model. It combines the Mamba method
  with a U-Net architecture, incorporating a residual spatial modeling unit for enhanced
  feature extraction and an efficient decoding unit to reduce computation. Experiments
  on the Synapse dataset show that MUnet-Lite achieves a Dice score of 83.79% and
  a Hausdorff distance of 16.43mm, with only 26.71M parameters and 925.9 GFLOPs, significantly
  lowering computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. This provides
  a practical solution for real-world applications.
