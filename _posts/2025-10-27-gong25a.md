title: YOLOv11-based Flame Recognition Algorithm Utilizing a Fusion Dual-stream Attention
  Mechanism
abstract: Flame change characteristics are affected by ignition source, air pressure,
  wind direction and other factors, and the traditional method describes the problems
  of leakage, false alarm and poor real-time performance. Vision-based image detection
  is one of the important means to solve the above problems. Therefore, a YOLOv11
  optimized flame detection algorithm is proposed. First, the feature extraction PCF
  module is designed to enhance the characterization of different layers of feature
  maps. Second, the model incorporates the dual-stream mechanism attention mechanism
  to improve the attention to different scale features. Finally, the model introduces
  an improved Focal Loss function to optimize the regression accuracy and network
  robustness in the prediction region. The model is subjected to comparative experiments
  on the Flame public dataset. The results show that the improved model performs well
  for flame smoke detection in complex scenarios, reaching 49.6% on mAP50 and 18.9%
  on mAP75, which is an improvement of 2% and 8% in accuracy compared to the original
  YOLOv11 model.
