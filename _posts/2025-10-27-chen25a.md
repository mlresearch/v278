title: An Improved YOLOv11 Algorithm For Traffic Sign Detection
abstract: As an important part of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), traffic
  sign recognition is of great significance for ensuring driving safety and improving
  traffic efficiency. This paper proposes a method that incorporates three modules,
  namely Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), Spatial and Channel Synergistic Attention
  (SCSA), and Omni-Dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), into YOLOv11, aiming
  to enhance the performance of traffic sign detection. By enhancing the adaptability
  of feature scales through ASFF, optimizing feature extraction and fusion with SCSA,
  and strengthening the convolution operation with ODConv, the research results effectively
  improve the recognition accuracy and speed of various road signs on complex roads.
  Experimental results show that this integrated model outperforms the original YOLOv11
  model and other comparative models in the traffic sign detection task, providing
  a more effective detection solution for the intelligent transportation field.
