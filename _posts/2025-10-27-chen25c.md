title: SDE for Olympic selection Based on Dynamic Bayesian Network
abstract: This paper concentrates on the evaluation of Sports, Disciplines, or Events
  (SDEs) for Olympic selection. It presents a comprehensive approach that integrates
  multiple methods. The Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) is at the core, supplemented
  by data collection, normalization, and the TOPSIS method. This approach allows for
  a systematic assessment of SDEs, taking into account various criteria such as popularity,
  gender equity, and sustainability. The modelâ€™s outcomes provide valuable predictions
  for future Olympic SDE selection, and sensitivity analyses confirm its stability.
  The research proposes a data-centric approach for the International Olympic Committee
  (IOC) to refine and enhance the Olympic sports program, leveraging insights from
  AI and analytics.
