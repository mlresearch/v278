title: An object detection algorithm for complex urban scenarios based on YOLOv11
abstract: 'In recent years, with the rapid development of fields such as autonomous
  driving and intelligent transportation, the detection of pedestrians and vehicles
  in complex urban scenarios has become a hot topic in the field of object detection.
  However, these complex urban scenarios pose significant challenges to object detection.
  This paper proposes an improved algorithm based on YOLOv11, namely the YOLOv11 -
  APAS - MDC algorithm for object detection in complex urban scenarios on the Urban
  Environment Detection dataset. The aim is to enhance the accuracy and robustness
  of detecting pedestrians and vehicles under conditions such as occlusion and multi
  - scale targets in complex urban environments. This paper proposes a multi - scale
  edge information enhancement module called APAS based on the YOLOv11 basic model.
  This module highlights important edge feature information and can improve the modelâ€™s
  perception ability of multi - scale features. Secondly, this paper presents the
  MDC module. By using convolutional layers with different dilation rates, this module
  can extract features at different scales. In addition, this paper introduces the
  RepGFPN feature network. This network re - parameterizes the structure and reduces
  redundant operations. Through a more complex cross - layer connection mechanism,
  it enhances the interaction of features at different levels, thereby improving the
  performance and efficiency of the detection model. The experimental verification
  results on the Urban Environment Detection dataset show that the improved algorithm
  in this paper outperforms the traditional YOLOv11 algorithm in terms of detection
  accuracy and robustness under conditions such as occlusion and multi - scale targets. '
