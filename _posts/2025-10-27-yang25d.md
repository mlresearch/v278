title: Viral Load-Driven Modeling of Epidemic Spread in Networks
abstract: 'This paper studies epidemic transmission in scale-free networks using an
  SIS model with viral load-dependent infectivity. A network disease model is developed
  and analyzed via HMF theory, deriving the basic reproduction number   and its link
  to equilibrium stability. Simulations showing how viral load, network heterogeneity,
  and scale jointly affect transmission. Experiments indicate that:  High-er initial
  viral load   increases infection prevalence; larger degree exponent reduces infection
  due to low-degree node â€œtransmission dead ends"; infection grows with network size
  in scale-free networks.'
