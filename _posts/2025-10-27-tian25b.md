title: The Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Bearings Based on ICPO-TCN
abstract: In modern industrial equipment maintenance management, bearings, as key
  rotating components, perform a crucial role in maintaining the stable performance
  of machinery. Therefore, this paper proposes a bearing Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
  prediction method based on the Improved Crested Porcupine Optimizer-Time Convolutional
  Network (ICPO-TCN). Firstly, the improved crested porcupine optimizer (ICPO) is
  used to search for the best number of modes and penalty factor in VMD, enabling
  the selection of effective components for signal reconstruction, noise reduction,
  and enhanced time-frequency feature extraction. A feature dataset is then constructed
  by combining the selected time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics. Next,
  reducing the dimensionality by kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), which
  is then used as input for the TCN model. Finally, ICPO is again employed to optimize
  the convolution kernel size and learning rate of the TCN to improve RUL prediction
  accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that ICPO-TCN outperforms traditional
  TCN and LSTM models, achieving higher prediction accuracy.
