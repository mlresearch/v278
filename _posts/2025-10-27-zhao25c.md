title: 'HBADTI: Drug-target interaction prediction based on multi head attention and
  bidirectional cross attention'
abstract: The study of drug-target interactions (DTIs) holds critical importance in
  the drug development process. The core challenge in DTI prediction lies in accurately
  capturing the features of both drugs and proteins, as well as thoroughly understanding
  their interaction mechanisms. In light of this, we developed an end-to-end DTI prediction
  model called HBADTI. The model employs graph convolutional networks to encode drug
  features. For protein feature extraction, we designed a dedicated feature extraction
  module (ESAM) that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multi-head
  self-attention mechanisms to effectively capture protein sequence characteristics.
  Subsequently, a bidirectional cross-attention network is utilized to integrate the
  features of both drugs and proteins, followed by a multilayer perceptron to classify
  unknown drug-target pairs.Comparative experimental results demonstrate that HBADTI
  outperforms multiple baseline methods. Ablation studies further confirm that both
  the bidirectional attention network and the ESAM module significantly contribute
  to the improvement of DTI prediction performance.
