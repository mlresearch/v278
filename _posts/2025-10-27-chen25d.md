title: Modeling and Analysis of Olympic Medal Table Based on Multiple Features
abstract: In the first part, this study first used the winning records and medal data
  of Olympic competitions. Based on the relevant variation characteristics of medal
  counts, their impact was assessed by quantifying the fluctuation of medal counts
  under multiple characteristics. For medal counts, they were incorporated into a
  medal prediction model under time series through stacked integration. LR, LASSO,
  SVM, and Catboost were used as base leaners in the first layer ; RF, XGBoost, and
  LightGBM were used in the second layer of the meta-learner; and the optimal stacked
  integration learning for medal count prediction under time series was subsequently
  determined. Subsequently, the medal standings for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los
  Angeles, USA were predicted under dynamic simulation as the entire sequential system
  was varied. Based on the parameter-adjusted feature structure of countries without
  medal counts, two evaluation models were constructed, one of which was initialized
  with a fixed medal-associated parameter ratio. According to the model framework,
  the impact of no medal data is parameterized according to the model parameter distribution
  law to complete the analysis of countries with no medal counts.
