title: Speech Enhancement for Headphones Based on Spectrum Subtraction and DMA
abstract: For headphone speech enhancement, traditional mono noise reduction methods,
  such as Wiener filter, have limited noise reduction effects and large computational
  costs, the directivity of the differential microphone array (DMA) is used to optimize
  the voice pickup and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the input signal. Experimental
  simulation results show that the proposed method improves the output signal-to-noise
  ratio by 6dB under different output signal-to-noise ratios, and still has a 2dB
  speech enhancement effect under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio of -5dB,
  and has strong anti-interference ability. The effect is stable in the background
  of broadband noise and low-frequency noise, which can better optimize the userâ€™s
  experience during call.
