title: Low-Dose CT Reconstruction Based on Fused State-Space Modelling
abstract: Low-dose CT is widely used in medical imaging, but reducing the radiation
  dose introduces noise that affects image quality. To this end, we propose a low-dose
  CT reconstruction method based on fused state-space modelling, which uses the FuseSSM
  module to extract contextual information in the spatial and channel domains, balances
  short-range and long-range sensitivities, and introducesthe Axial Attention mechanism
  to reduce the computational complexity, while enhancing the remote-dependent modelling
  and global texture consistency. The experiments validate the model on the Mayo-2016
  dataset, which outperforms the comparative methods in PSNR, SSIM and RMSE metrics,
  showing good potential for clinical applications.
