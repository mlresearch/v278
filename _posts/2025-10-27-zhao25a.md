title: Structure Interaction Dehazing Network Combined with YCbCr Color Space for
  Real-World Image Dehazing
abstract: 'Dehazing in the RGB space often causes artifacts and detail blurring due
  to the difficulty in separating luminance and color. Traditional encoder-decoder
  models also suffer from semantic discontinuity and insufficient multi-scale feature
  interaction. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called the Structure
  Interaction Dehazing Network (SIDN), which leverages the advantages of the YCbCr
  color space in separating color and luminance to guide RGB feature extraction. SIDN
  consists of two core components: the Dual-space Feature Branch (DFB) and the Cross-Feature
  Block (CFB). The DFB integrates YCbCr features through the Phase Fusion Module (PFM)
  and Density-aware Feature Extraction Block (DFEB), enhancing texture recovery and
  guiding RGB feature reconstruction. The CFB improves multi-scale feature interaction
  and semantic alignment through an enhanced cross-layer mechanism. Experimental results
  show that SIDN achieves a 1.25dB improvement in PSNR and SSIM metrics on real-world
  datasets compared to previous methods, and also outperforms the latest methods in
  terms of FADE and NIQE metrics.'
