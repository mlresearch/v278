title: 'FENet: Frequency-Enhanced Network Based on AFFormer for Wood Surface Defect
  Detection'
abstract: The bark is one of the major defects affecting the value of Eucalyptus veneer
  and must be accurately identified during detection. Currently, for bark defects
  exhibiting multiple shapes and colors, spatial-domain-based semantic segmentation
  models often encounter issues with semantic information loss in regions where the
  color or shape changes, which can lead to incomplete segmentation results. In contrast,
  utilizing texture features in the frequency domain can reduce the interference caused
  by variations in color and shape for the model, thereby enabling more effective
  identification of bark defects. Therefore, in this paper, a Frequency-Enhanced network
  based on Adaptive Frequency Transformer (AFFormer) is proposed. First, we propose
  an Inverted Depth-wise Separable Stem to extract more texture information by expanding
  the number of feature map channels through inverted depth-wise separable convolution.
  Moreover, we adopt the Rectangular Self-Calibration Module to refine the AFFormer
  as the backbone network. This enhances the ability to localize bark defects with
  different shapes and extracts frequency characteristics that are beneficial for
  semantic segmentation. Finally, the Frequency-Enhanced Channel Attention module
  enhances the frequency features for semantic segmentation and fuses the spatial-domain
  feature maps to recover the local details, thereby effectively improving the segmentation
  accuracy of multi-scale bark defects. Experimental results show that FENet outperforms
  existing semantic segmentation methods for segmenting bark defects.
