title: A Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Natural Product-Protein Interactions
abstract: " Natural products (NPs) are valuable resources for drug development, but
  accurately predicting their interactions with protein targets remains challenging
  due to the limitations of existing methods, which primarily rely on either ligand-based
  approaches or hybrid feature-based methods that require protein pocket data. To
  address these limitations, we developed a Y-shaped machine learning framework that
  integrates NP structural data with protein sequence information. We constructed
  a comprehensive NP-protein interaction dataset and extracted features from NPs,
  including Atom Sequence Path (ASP), PubChem, and Extended Connectivity Fingerprints
  (ECFP), as well as protein features such as Amino Acid Composition (AAC), Conjoint
  Triad (CTriad), and Dipeptide Composition (DPC). Six machine learning models—Random
  Forest (RF), AdaBoost, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Stochastic Gradient Descent
  (SGD), and Logistic Regression (LR)—were trained and evaluated. Experimental results
  demonstrated that NP-derived PubChem features and protein-derived DPC features were
  the most effective, with XGBoost achieving the best performance among all models.
  Our study provides an efficient and generalizable framework for NP-protein interaction
  prediction, significantly advancing the potential for drug discovery."
