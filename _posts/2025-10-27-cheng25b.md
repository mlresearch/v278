title: Ground States of Mixed Local and Nonlocal System of Choquard Type
abstract: This paper establishes the existence of solution for a family of weakly
  coupled nonlinear Choquard-type system. We apply variational methods and utilize
  the introduced manifold  $\mathcal{N}_{\omega}  $ to investigate this problem.
