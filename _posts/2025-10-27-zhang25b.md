title: Multi-instance Causal Representation Learning-based Network for Glioma Grading
abstract: Gliomas are the most common primary intracranial malignant tumors, characterized
  by high heterogeneity, recurrence, and mortality. Accurate grading is essential
  for treatment planning and prognosis assessment. MRI, as a non-invasive modality,
  is widely used, but traditional diagnosis depends on expert experience, leading
  to subjectivity and inefficiency. AI-based automatic grading has made progress,
  yet challenges persist due to tumor boundary ambiguity, structural heterogeneity,
  and the â€œblack box" nature of AI models, limiting robustness, generalization, and
  interpretability. To address these issues, this study proposes a multi-instance
  causal representation learning-based network for glioma grading (MCRNet). MCRNet
  employs multi-instance learning to aggregate MRI slice features, effectively handling
  tumor heterogeneity. The causal-aware attention mechanism (CAAM) and causal-aware
  dynamic aggregation mechanism (CDAM) enhance feature selection and aggregation efficiency.
  Evaluated on BraTS2020 and a private clinical dataset, MCRNet improves robustness,
  generalization, and interpretability. It minimizes the performance gap between validation
  and test sets, reducing the AUC difference by up to 3.21% compared to existing methods,
  demonstrating its potential for reliable clinical application.
