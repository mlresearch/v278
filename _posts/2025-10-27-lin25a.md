title: Multidimensional Danmaku Analytics via a BERT-SVM Fusion Model
abstract: Danmaku (bullet comments), characterized by real-time interactivity, high
  concurrency, and textual fragmentation, present unique challenges for semantic analysis
  in film audience feedback research. To address the limitations of conventional methods
  in processing sparse short texts and imbalanced data distributions, this study proposes
  a BERT-SVM fusion model integrating BERT-based semantic representation with SVM
  classification, supplemented by SMOTE oversampling. Validated on 450,000 Danmaku
  comments from The Wandering Eart series, the framework achieves a sentiment classification
  accuracy of 92.6%. Furthermore, a multidimensional analysis pipeline is implemented,
  combining BERT embedding compression, KMeans clustering, and LDA topic modeling
  to systematically identify audience discussion themes. Experimental results demonstrate
  that The Wandering Earth 2 not only elicits a higher proportion of positive sentiment
  than its predecessor but also shifts thematic focus toward advanced sci-fi elements
  such as digital life and lunar crisis resolution. This work establishes an efficient
  analytical framework for large-scale Danmaku data, offering actionable insights
  to enhance narrative design and audience engagement strategies in the film industry.
