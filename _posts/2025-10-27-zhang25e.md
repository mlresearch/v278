title: 'JSOSAL: Joint Sampling for Open-Set Active Learning'
abstract: " Traditional active learning methods typically operate under closed-set
  assumptions, where unlabeled data samples are selected for annotation from a pool
  consisting exclusively of known classes. However, real-world scenarios predominantly
  exhibit open-set conditions, characterized by the presence of substantial unknown-class
  instances within datasets. This fundamental discrepancy renders most conventional
  active learning approaches ineffective in practical applications.To address the
  annotation challenge in open-set environments, we propose JSOSAL (Joint Sampling
  for Open-Set Active Learning), an innovative approach that applies a Bayesian Gaussian
  Mixture Model (BGMM) to represent the probability distribution of the highest activation
  values, enabling effective discrimination between known and unknown classes. Our
  method subsequently selects high-entropy samples from the identified known-class
  subset for annotation. Rigorous testing on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 shows that JSOSAL
  achieves superior performance compared to existing leading methods."
