title: An improved YOLOv11 algorithm for rice diseases
abstract: The timely identification of rice diseases is of vital importance to national
  food security. This paper proposes an improved model based on YOLOv11, and uses
  three key innovations to enhance the detection performance of the model. Firstly,
  DynamicConv enables the network to increase the number of parameters while maintaining
  a low number of floating-point operations (FLOPs), allowing these networks to benefit
  from large-scale visual pre-training. Secondly, the iterative attention feature
  fusion (iAFF) improves the detection accuracy by enhancing the feature fusion process.
  In addition, the Synergistic Cross-Scale Attention module (SCSA) is designed to
  effectively combine the advantages of channel and spatial attention, making full
  use of multi-semantic information, thus improving the performance of visual tasks.
  The experimental results show that the innovated model can effectively improve the
  detection efficiency of rice diseases, providing a reliable solution for agricultural
  security.
