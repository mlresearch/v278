title: 'Decoding Olympic Glory: A Data-Driven Approach to Medal Predictions and Strategic
  Insights'
abstract: 'The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of data science
  and machine learning to find optimal performance levels for athletes and maximize
  strategies for national improvement. Utilizing Olympic data from 1986 to 2024, it
  implements the Fusion Medal Prediction Model (FMPM) to assist decision-making for
  athletes and coaches. Initially, we establish the XG-Prophet Model to forecast the
  2028 Olympic medal table with MAE equals to 1.09/0.95/1.12/2.24 for gold/silver/bronze/total
  medals respectively. Additionally, GRU-ARIMA + XGBoost (Fusion Learning, ROC-AUC:
  0.917) to identify the first winner. Furthermore, we explore medal distributions
  based on event types, employing K-means clustering to observe different contributions
  by country and finds that field and swimming events are key across all countries
  but with varying importance. An examination of event selection on a country-to-country
  basis through correlation shows that if the host country selects stronger events,
  even potentially favoring those in which they can excel, their numbers of medals
  naturally increase.'
