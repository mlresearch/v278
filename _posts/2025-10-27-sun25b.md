title: 'Dynamic Trading Strategies for Volatile Assets: A Hybrid GM-LSTM Model with
  Finite State Machine Optimization'
abstract: 'This study addresses the challenge of predicting investments in highly
  volatile assets, such as gold and ancient coins, by proposing a hybrid forecasting
  strategy that integrates the Grey Model (GM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and
  Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). A finite automaton-based trading decision model is developed
  to enable rapid decision-making in dynamic market environments. Traditional methods
  often struggle to adapt to the unpredictability of such assets, prompting the need
  for advanced predictive frameworks. The methodology encompasses data preprocessing,
  model training, and validation, with a focus on optimizing short- and long-term
  forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid GM-LSTM strategy significantly
  enhances prediction accuracy: GM excels in short-term forecasting (first 200 days)
  due to its efficiency with limited data, while LSTM outperforms in long-term scenarios
  by capturing complex temporal dependencies. A dynamic weight adjustment mechanism,
  incorporating profit (PI) and risk indices (RI), balances returns and risks. Sensitivity
  analysis reveals the model’s robustness under varying transaction costs (0.1%–10%),
  maintaining profitability even at higher cost levels. Key performance metrics—annualized
  return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown—validate the strategy’s superiority over
  benchmarks like buy-and-hold. The state machine-driven trading model, evaluated
  through Value at Risk (VaR) and sliding window protocols, ensures adaptability across
  market conditions. This work provides traders with a data-driven decision-making
  tool, optimizing investment strategies while mitigating risks in volatile markets.'
