title: Evolution of Bitcoin Trust Communities
abstract: Bitcoin, a digital currency facilitated by blockchain technology, enables
  direct exchange and personal ownership of digital assets, verified through mathematical
  consensus. This paper explores and analyzes transaction data within the Bitcoin
  network, with a focus on improving the efficiency of entity recognition methods
  and identifying illegal transaction patterns. We begin by introducing Bitcoin’s
  development background, underlying principles, and transaction processes. We then
  delve into the structure of Bitcoin transaction data and review recent literature
  on its analysis, summarizing key technologies and research directions. To address
  the inefficiencies of traditional heuristic entity recognition methods, we propose
  an innovative solution that establishes entity relationship sets and utilizes active
  address data. Our approach introduces specific advancements, including a novel algorithm
  designed to enhance network connectivity and stability, and a centrality aggregation
  index that outperforms traditional node centrality indices. This algorithm facilitates
  quick reconnection to previously successful peer nodes, discovers new nodes upon
  connection loss, and propagates node information across the network for more stable
  connections. Additionally, it employs a seed node mechanism to expedite network
  discovery. Our method leverages a core data structure that maintains a list of peers
  for initial connections, automated through a seed node process. This bootstrapping
  mechanism allows Bitcoin clients to efficiently connect to the entire Bitcoin network.
  For implementation and analysis, we utilize NetworkX, a Python package for manipulating
  and investigating complex networks. We visualize the network structure using the
  number of transactions or reviews as node size, average review sentiment as node
  color, review mistrust as edge length, and a force-directed algorithm for node positioning.
  Our results demonstrate that the first-order aggregation centrality index performs
  better than the node centrality index, confirming that incorporating more information
  about first-order correlation attributes around a node enhances the model’s effectiveness.
  Our proposed model, integrating the centrality aggregation index, achieves a 1%
  improvement in precision, a 5% improvement in recall, and a 4% improvement in F1
  score compared to the original feature set model. We define C as the node centrality
  feature set, C1 as the first-order aggregated feature set, C2 as the second-order
  aggregated feature set, and AF as the original feature set. From both model performance
  and visualization perspectives, the centrality aggregation index enables quick identification
  of key nodes and enhances the discovery of illegal transaction patterns in the network.
  By reversing and backtracking the capital flow path, our method can uncover more
  illegal transaction nodes and provide greater interpretability for the illegal transaction
  model. Finally, we discuss how to analyze and identify illegal behavior characteristics
  in Bitcoin transaction data, concluding with an examination of data sources, network
  construction, and analysis methods. By offering a comprehensive exploration of Bitcoin
  transaction data and advancing entity recognition methods, this paper provides valuable
  insights into the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.
  Our proposed innovations result in significant efficiency improvements and enhanced
  detection of illegal activities within the Bitcoin network.
