title: A Spectrum Filtering Framework for Domain Generalization
abstract: Domain generalization aims to address the distribution shift problem inherent
  in neural networks, wherein a misalignment between test data distribution and training
  data distribution leads to significant performance degradation. This paper introduces
  Fourier Style Restitution (FSR), a Fourier-transform-driven method for domain generalization.
  FSR integrates the principles of Fourier augmentation and style disentanglement
  with feature reconstruction, enhancing model generalizability to unseen domains.
  The framework implements a cross-domain filtering enhancement strategy based on
  Fourier transform, leveraging frequency domain filtering to bolster model robustness
  against distributional variations. Through this paradigm, each sample transcends
  source domain constraints to derive optimized domain-invariant feature representations
  tailored to its intrinsic characteristics. The framework further incorporates style
  regularization to distill consistency signals from stylized images and employs prototype
  compensation to recover lost domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The methodâ€™s efficacy stems
  from feature enhancement and style reconstruction through Fourier-based operations
  for robust domain generalization.
