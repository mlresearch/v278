title: Small Sample Patents Classification Task Based on Mengzi-BERT-base Single Model
abstract: Small sample data classification faces challenges such as data scarcity,
  overfitting risks, and feature representation learning. In order to tackle these
  challenges, the present study proposes a transfer learning methodology that leverages
  the insights gained from extensive datasets or pre-trained models to enhance the
  model’s capacity for generalization. Furthermore, meta-learning methodologies facilitate
  the rapid adaptation of models to novel tasks using a limited number of samples
  by employing strategies that enhance the learning process itself. Concurrently,
  data augmentation techniques enhance both the diversity and volume of samples through
  the synthesis, expansion, or transformation of small datasets, thereby augmenting
  the model’s generalization capabilities. The paper also presents an active learning
  method that uses the uncertainty and information gain of the model to automatically
  select the most valuable samples for labeling to optimize the training effect of
  the model. It solves the problem of obtaining large-scale annotated data in many
  practical scenarios, and provides efficient classification and analysis of small
  amounts of annotated data. Moreover, it serves as the basis of zero-sample learning,
  which has important knowledge transfer and application value. The paper concludes
  by showing that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods on a benchmark
  dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of small sample
  data classification.
