title: Survey on Path Planning Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: " In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated significant
  potential in the field of path planning and control, offering breakthrough solutions
  for path planning in dynamic and complex environments. DRL has been widely applied
  in UAV obstacle avoidance, autonomous vehicle path optimization, multi-robot coordination,
  and complex terrain navigation, demonstrating ad-vantages such as superior path
  quality, improved smoothness, and enhanced safety. This paper provides a systematic
  review of recent advances and applications of DRL core techniques. Value-based methods
  (e.g. DQN) significantly improve decision-making efficiency through optimized reward
  design and network architectures. Policy gradient algorithms (such as PPO, DDPG,
  and TD3) achieve high-precision control in continuous action spaces. The Actor-Critic
  framework, combined with double Q-networks and delayed update mechanisms (e.g. TD3),
  further expands the application scenarios. Future research should focus on enhancing
  cross-scenario generalization capabilities and improving deployment efficiency at
  the industrial level, thereby promoting the practical application of DRL in autonomous
  driving and industrial robotics."
