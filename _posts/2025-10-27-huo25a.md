title: Uncovering the Secrets of Momentum Hidden in the Game of Tennis
abstract: 'Advances in sports technology have had a profound impact on the tennis
  game, not only improving the fairness and enjoyment of the game, but also changing
  the way players are trained and performance analyzed. This article builds a momentum
  evaluation model and deeply explores the impact of momentum on game results based
  on the game data set. Before building the model, we cleaned and standardized the
  given data and classified it into four parts: fatigue level, psychological state,
  personal technical ability, and real-time conditions. Preliminary preparations were
  made for the construction and solution of the model. We developed a comprehensive
  tennis player “momentum” evaluation model using Logistic-LGBM, employing point granularity
  and five-fold cross validation. This model dynamically assesses and captures real-time
  changes in player momentum. Our real-time visualization during the 2023 Wimbledon
  men’s singles final revealed observable momentum trends. However, due to the complexity
  of factors affecting player scores, not accounting for them introduced significant
  noise and disrupted player scores. This insight serves as a foundation for refining
  the model.'
