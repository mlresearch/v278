title: Rate-controllable Learned Image Compression Using Channel Attention
abstract: Classical learned image compression (LIC) methods usually require training
  multiple models to achieve the best compression performances at different rates,
  which greatly increases their training and deployment cost. Though existing methods
  can realize rate variation by using channel scaling factors or transform of the
  Lagrange multiplier, they are not able to adaptively control the compression process
  with desired rates, which causes additional trial cost if we want to obtain results
  with given compression ratios. In this paper, we address this issue by employing
  channel attention modules that use the desired target bit-rate as side information
  to adjust the distributions of feature channels, and a new rate-distortion loss
  function that integrates the target bit-rate into the rate-distortion optimization
  framework is proposed to train the model to realize continuous rate control. Additionally,
  a two-stage training strategy is utilized to ensure that the network can adaptively
  adjust the bit-rates, at the same time achieving the best rate-distortion performance.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves effective rate control
  over a wide range of bit-per-pixels (BPPs).
