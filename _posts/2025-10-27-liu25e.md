title: An Inexact Golden Ratio Primal-Dual Algorithm for a Saddle Point Problem
abstract: Convex optimization problems have wide applications in many fields such
  as mathematics, finance, industrial engineering, and management science. The primal
  dual algorithm (PDA), which is a classical approach for tackling a certain class
  of convex-concave saddle point problems, still has shortcomings such as fixed step
  size and difficulty in accurately solving certain subproblems. Therefore, designing
  more efficient inexact algorithms to solve these problems has important practical
  significance. During this investigation, we introduce an inexact golden ratio primal-dual
  algorithm based on the absolute error criteria of non-negative summable sequences.
  We establish the global convergence and the $O(1/N)$ rate of convergence for the
  proposed inexact algorithm, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified
  by the image restoration experiment.
