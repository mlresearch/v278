title: Research on Data Mining Techniques Based on DeepSeek-R1
abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, data mining,
  as one of its important application fields, is facing new opportunities and challenges.
  DeepSeek-R1, as an advanced pre-trained model, provides new technical means for
  data mining with its powerful feature extraction capabilities and efficient inference
  performance. This paper systematically investigates data mining techniques based
  on DeepSeek-R1, offering a comprehensive exploration of technical principles, application
  methods, and performance optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepSeek-R1
  exhibits significant performance advantages in data mining tasks, and corresponding
  optimization strategies are proposed. The research in this paper not only enriches
  the theoretical system of data mining technology but also provides valuable references
  for practical applications.
