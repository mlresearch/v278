title: 'GANFL: A log anomaly detection method based on collaborative optimization
  of federated learning and generative adversarial networks'
abstract: " With the rapid development of information technology, the amount of data
  is growing explosively. Enterprises and society have an increasing demand for data
  storage, processing and analysis. Data centers have emerged as the times require.
  They can centrally manage massive amounts of data, provide efficient computing and
  storage capabilities, meet the high requirements of different industries for data
  processing, and ensure data security and reliability. In data centers, numerous
  devices, systems and applications continuously generate a large number of logs during
  operation. These logs record the activities and status information at all levels
  of the data center, including the operating status of the server, the traffic of
  network devices, and the operation records of applications. Log anomalies refer
  to the presence of records that do not conform to normal patterns or expected content
  in the log files that record the operating systemâ€™s own operating events. Log analysis
  can help developers quickly locate the source of the fault. By analyzing the log
  data, they can determine the device where the fault occurred and the cause of the
  fault. At the same time, they can also conduct advance analysis based on the existing
  log data to discover potential problems.In this paper, the method of co-optimization
  of GAN and federated learning is adopted, which not only solves the problem of data
  silos, but also solves the problem of insufficient data."
