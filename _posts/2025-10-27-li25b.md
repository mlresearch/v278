title: Digital Twin-Assisted Satellite-Ground Cooperative Edge Network Resource Optimization
  Method
abstract: To address the challenge of efficiently processing data on resource-constrained
  IoT devices, this paper proposes a digital twin architecture for satellite-terrestrial
  collaborative edge networks and introduces Coordinated Constrained DDPG (CC_DDPG),
  a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based task offloading and resource allocation
  algorithm tailored for model training tasks. First, digital twin models for UAVs
  and satellites are constructed to enable real-time network state monitoring and
  decision support. Second, the joint optimization of task offloading, communication,
  and computing resources is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). By enhancing
  the actor network in the conventional DDPG method, the proposed algorithm dynamically
  balances training latency and energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate
  that CC_DDPG significantly outperforms benchmark heuristic algorithms in convergence
  stability and multi-objective optimization performance.
