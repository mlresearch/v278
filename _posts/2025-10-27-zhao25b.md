title: A Quantum Game Model and Simulation Study on Collaborative Operation of Container
  Sea-Rail Intermodal Transport
abstract: Under the new development pattern of â€œdouble circulation" and the continuous
  promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative, the demand for container sea-rail intermodal
  transport is increasing day by day, and the efficiency and stability of its collaborative
  operation become the key. This paper focuses on this, and constructs a quantum game
  model for the coordinated operation of container sea rail intermodal transport.
  The model brings the relevant stakeholders such as shipping enterprises and railway
  transport enterprises into the game framework, and analyzes the benefits under different
  strategy combinations. Through the design of simulation experiments, the model is
  verified. The results show that this model can accurately describe the decision-making
  behavior and synergy effect of various stakeholders, provide a new theory and method
  for optimizing the collaborative operation of sea rail intermodal transport, and
  help to improve the overall operation efficiency and service level.
