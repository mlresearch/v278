title: Application of Genetic Algorithm-Optimized Backpropagation Network in Library
  Energy Consumption Prediction
abstract: The development of building energy consumption prediction models is crucial
  for achieving sustainable development in the construction industry; however, establishing
  rational, accurate, and efficient models to promote energy conservation and enhance
  energy utilization efficiency remains a challenge. This study takes libraries as
  a representative building type, selecting operational hours, humidity, maximum temperature,
  occupancy density, and solar irradiance as key influencing factors to construct
  a Genetic Algorithm-optimized Backpropagation (GA-BP) neural network for energy
  consumption prediction. Comparative experiments with a standard Backpropagation
  (BP) neural network, Regularized Radial Basis Function (RRBF) neural network, and
  Generalized Radial Basis Function (GRBF) neural network demonstrate the superior
  fitting performance of the GA-BP model, providing reliable scientific support for
  library energy management and offering a practical framework for energy-efficient
  building operations.
