title: Dispersive optical solitons of the stochastic Fokas-Lenells equation with multiplicative
  white noise based on the trial equation method
abstract: In this paper, we study the Fokas-Lenells (FL) equation with multiplicative
  white noise in the It√¥ sense for polarization-maintaining fibers, using the trial
  equation method and the polynomial complete discriminant system approach. All exact
  solutions of the equation in its general form are obtained, including solitary wave
  solutions, trigonometric function solutions, rational solutions, and Jacobian elliptic
  function doubly periodic solutions. Furthermore, several representative numerical
  simulation results are presented under given parameter conditions.
