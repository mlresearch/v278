title: Optimizing the Path of AIGC Creative Content Generation Based on Large Language
  Models and Knowledge Graphs
abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AIGC)
  technologies, creative content generation using large language models (LLMs) and
  knowledge graphs (KGs) has become a key area of research. However, current methods
  often fail to fully harness the semantic enhancement capabilities of knowledge graphs
  in the content generation process. To address this gap, this paper proposes an innovative
  creative content generation path optimization model, KG-GPT-opt, which integrates
  large language models with knowledge graphs. Experimental results demonstrate that
  the KG-GPT-opt model outperforms traditional baseline models across several standard
  evaluation metrics, achieving improvements of 6.4%, 7.5%, and 4.8% in BLEU, ROUGE-L,
  and METEOR, respectively. Furthermore, the model receives high expert ratings of
  8.6 and 8.8 for creativity and coherence, surpassing other generation models. This
  study offers a novel approach for the AIGC field, advancing the integration of large
  language models and knowledge graphs, and broadening the potential applications
  of intelligent content generation in areas such as cultural creativity and smart
  marketing.
