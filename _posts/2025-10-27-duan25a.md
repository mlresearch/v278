title: Enhanced YOLOv8-Based Lightweight Algorithm for Flame Detection
abstract: This paper presents an enhanced real-time lightweight fire flame detection
  algorithm based on improved YOLOv8n. To address the challenges of flame detection
  in complex scenarios, the algorithm integrates the RVB Block and EMA attention mechanism
  into the YOLOv8n backbone, enhancing its ability to capture fire features accurately.
  Additionally, a lightweight Slim-Neck structure is introduced to reduce computational
  complexity and parameters, facilitating embedded deployment. The proposed WiseIoU
  loss function further accelerates convergence and optimizes bounding box loss. Experiments
  demonstrate that the improved algorithm achieves a precision rate of 97.7%, a mAP@50
  of 98% and a recall rate of 94.4%, with a 16% reduction in parameters and a 1.7
  reduction in GFLOPs. The algorithmâ€™s lightweight nature and high accuracy provide
  strong technical support for early fire warning and control.
